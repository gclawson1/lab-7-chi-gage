```

This: I'm Gage and I'm updating this markdown file. 



```{r}
library(tidyverse)

gc_df <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")

```


We are asking: Is there a significant difference in reccomended gun control action for male and female respondents (should guns be easier, harder, or the same difficulty to get). 

Excellent question!! I am very interested in the results. 

Gage: data wrangling and counts

```{r}

get_guns <- gc_df %>%
  filter(make_get_guns != "NA", gender != "NA") %>%
  count(gender, make_get_guns)
  
```
